# giving-map

The **Giving Map** is a dynamic, data-driven JavaScript web application that presents an interactive, color-coded map view of geographic locations (in the current implementation, U.S. counties and other U.S. territories/locations with FIPS codes). The map is populated using JSON values provided through an external API. The map can display health, census, climate, or any other category of data, as long as it is linked to a specific location. Users click on counties based on their correspondence to color codes shown in the map legend. The app then zooms in to present the user with more detailed information for the location selected. The Giving Map also contains controls enabling users to connect to an external website and make donations based on the chosen geographic location and giving category.
